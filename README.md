# Cale-App-Rough-Draft
Compilation of files that compose a rough draft for an ideathon for a mental health app.

This app idea is dedicated to a guy I knew in middle school who emphasized the importance of not neglecting my own mental health to me and was born from me discovering concerning statistics about the overall population being in the midst of a mental health crisis.

How to use: Open a linux terminal on your device and type the command "git clone https://github.com/RavenTheBird789/Cale-App-Rough-Draft". From there, to execute the program in your terminal, type "python3 Cale.py"
